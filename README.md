# 🎮 Interactive Portfolio Game (Phaser)

An interactive 2D portfolio built using **Phaser**, where users explore a game world to learn more about me, my projects, and my technical experience.

Instead of a traditional static website, this portfolio transforms my profile into a playable dungeon-style experience.

## 🚀 Concept

This project reimagines a developer portfolio as a game.
